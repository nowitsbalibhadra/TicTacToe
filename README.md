# TicTacToe
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid
n a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first.
Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled.
If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins.
I made this project with help of java programming language.
basically I used the Concept of conditional Statements, 
Concept of loops, 
Concept of Branching Statements,
Concepts of Objects and Classes,
Concepts of String,
Concepts of Arrays, &
Concepts of HashSet.
Thank you so much
